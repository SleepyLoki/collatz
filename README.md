# Collatz
In this challenge, I will work with a mathematical conjecture proposed by a mathematician named Luthar Collatz.
To determine the Collatz sequence given a particular starting number, use the following rule set:

Given an input of n, the next number in is defined by:

n → n/2 (n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
Using the rule above we can determine what the Collatz Sequence for the following numbers are.
